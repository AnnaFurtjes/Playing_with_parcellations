# Playing with FreeSurfer annotation files
 The code displayed here was generated during my first exploration of FreeSurfer annotation files. Before I had any understanding of how FreeSurfer worked, I wanted to see whether I could use annotation files to work out percentages of regions in one atlas that may be used to approximate a region in another atlas. This is definitely not the accurate way of doing it, but it was a fun little exercise that may be handy for you if you are also learning to understand FreeSurfer data structures. https://annafurtjes.github.io/Playing_with_parcellations/Playing_with_labelling_protocols.html
